    <h1>The Biosphere</h1>
    <p>
        The biosphere is a life-supporting layer which surrounds the earth and makes plant and animal life possible without any protective device. The "organic world" or biosphere is that part of the earth which contains living organisms â€“ the biologically inhabited soil, air, and water (J. Tivy, 1982). 
    </p>
    <p>
        The biosphere consists of all the living organisms (the biotic component), energy (the energy component), and physical environment (the abiotic component). There are continuous interactions between living organisms and the physical environment, as well as among the living organisms themselves. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The average thickness of the biosphere or life-supporting layer, consisting of air, water, soil, and rock, is about 30 km. The upper limit of the biosphere is determined by the availability of oxygen, moisture, temperature, and air pressure. A decrease in oxygen, moisture, temperature, and air pressure with increasing height in the atmosphere limits the upper boundary of the biosphere. Though NASA has discovered the presence of bacteria up to a height of 15 km in the atmosphere, most living organisms are found in the lower layers of the atmosphere due to favorable environmental conditions for their growth and development.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lower limits of the biosphere are determined by the availability of the required amount of oxygen and light. Thus, the depth of the biosphere over land extends to the deepest roots of trees, the depth at which burrowing organisms can live, or the depth at which the parent bedrocks lie. The biosphere extends to greater depths in the oceans. The existence of life has been detected up to a depth of 9,000 meters in the deep oceanic trenches and deep-sea plains.
